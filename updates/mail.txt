Hi,
With those features you mentioned, accuracy increased to 51.43%.
Confusion Matrix:
 13     5     2
   3    15    14
   1     9     8
Rows: Predictions. 
Columns: Ground Truth.

In the paper, they claim an accuracy of 73.33% on CADDementia train dataset.

Better to compare accuracy when the dataset are same.
